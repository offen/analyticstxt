--- abstract

Privacy has become an important feature for users of websites and services. This document propopes a well-defined way for websites and services to signal their usage of analytics and tracking software to users and tooling used by users. analytics.txt aims to be an elaborate standard that describes the usage of analytics and tracking in a non-biased way that is understandable both for a non-technical audience, but also useful for consumption by tools and software.
